**MySQL** is used in most of the part of this application. The area like event list,
registration, Login form are rich with it and to reduce code and raise the security I
have used only one file for access DB.<br/>
![alt text](https://github.com/sagarwipro/sagarwipro.github.io/images/css.png?raw=true) **CSS**</b> made this application more
alive by features like linear-gradient, transition,
transform, hover, fonts, animation, fade in and out, etc.<br/>
The most important part is when we add some events, it creates text file and with name
of image and append the description section into the file. The image is not saved in DB
but in server. The DB holds only name of the image.<br>
Thanks to the **SESSION**, it helps to make session alive and never let you in without
logging in.

functionality of buttons and redirections most of the time here.<br/>
** Still working in it to add some more features like cart, event registration and more.**
